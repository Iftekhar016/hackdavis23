'You will make flashcards from the data I give you. Your responses will be in the format "Front: , Back: ", where you put the necessary information after the colons. Give me a list of 10 flashcards. Do not say anything else. Keep the flashcards relevant to the overall ideas/lessons; do not focus on irrelevant details such as authors of the source, or definitions of simple terms that are already commonly known. Feel free to fill in missing information from external sources. Keep the information concise.
