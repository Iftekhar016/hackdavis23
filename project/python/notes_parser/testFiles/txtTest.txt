## TIA

- typical topics:
    - Vehicular delay during peak hours
    - Parking supply and demand

- study scenarios
    - existing conditions to document present situation, existing + project
    - cumulative, cumulative + project

# Existing conditions

- interested in data about AM and PM peak hours
- collected data: number of turning movements at intersection, speed limits, special street uses, signal timings, parking data, gps travel times, collision data

# intersection turning movement counts

- traditional: video cameras at intersection to count
- alternative approach: gps location data

# intersection analysis

- synchro/simtraffic software stack to analyze vehicles delay at intersection
- synchro
    - applies deterministic equations (same input = same output)
- simtraffic
    - microsimulation tool
    - stochastic simulation (random behaviours assigned, not deterministic)
    - usually used for closley-spaced intersections, complex geometry, highly congested areas
- vissim
    - benefits over simtraffic:
        - different modes (pedestrians, bicycles, transit)
        - unusual intersection configs
        - complex signal timings

# Trip Generation

- commonly use ITE trip generation manual

# Mode choice

- approaches for estimating:
    - US Census/ACS data
    - local data (e.g. travel surveys, etc.)

# Trip Distribution

- understands peoples destinations and pairs their origins with the destination
- common data sources:
    - existing travel pattern data
    - ZIP code data
    - commute time data
    - Big Data (cellphone location data)
    - travel demand model

# Trip assignment

- once we know origin and dest, the road in which the travel takes place must be determined
- project-specific considerations:
    - quickest route is not always the route people take

# Existing + project

- more vehicles -> longer delay
- shorten trips by providing a closer destination (new Target in Davis prevented trips to further cities)

# Cumulative Forecasting Approaches

- apply travel demand model based on current data and other published studies
- use growth rate (both historic and published)
- Cube, Transcad are common modeling software

# Transportation Modeling

- 2 types of models:
    - Trip based model
    - Activity based model

# Activity based model

- 4 step model data is often very aggregated and trips are calculated based on larger zones (e.g. downtown sac might have only 10-20 zones)
- activity based model is basically a synthetic world that exists in a computer
    - starts with a demographic model and a synthetic population and simulates how people behave in a delay
    - gives finer detail and accuracy

# model validation

- once a model is run, the results must be validated (compare prediction with avaliable information)
- types of validation:
    - static: compare model traffic volume to actual traffic counts
    - dynamic: make sure model isn't causing changes outside of scope

# Limitations of traffic Forecasting

- e-commerce
- micromobility
- telecommunicating
- decreased transit usage (e.g. covid)
- ridehailing (rise of Uber and Lyft)

## Impacts and Mitigations

# entitlement review

- review projects and assess impact on local traffic systems (e.g. how will a local shopping center affect the traffic on the roadways and intersections)
- identifies any deficiencies and then improvements to fix thoses deficiencies
- deficiencies identified with respect to plans, policies, standards, etc.

# CEQA (California Environmental Quality Act)

- impacts identified in accordance with significant tresholds:
    - Environmental impacts
    - noise levels
    - multi-modal conflicts
    - conflicts with design standards
    - other disruptions
- If disruption -> mitigation measures are required

# Bicycle/predestrian mitigation measures

- implement planned improvement along project frontage or through project site
- modify site plans to accomodate design standards
- gap closure project (adding sidewalk, bike lane, etc. to accomodate other modes of travel)
- reduce potential for collisions by redesigning high risk roadways and intersections
- seperating modes (seperated bike lanes)

# Transit mitigation measures

- reduce delays to transit services:
    - transit only lanes
    - bus queue jumps
    - traffic signal modifcations (e.g. transit pre-emption)
        - can also be used by emergency vehicles
- improvement transit access:
    - constructing transit stations/stop
    - improve bicycle/pedestrian facilies near transit stations/stops
- increase transit capacity:
    - introduce new services
    - improve existing services (increase transit frequency, expand coverage both geographically and temporally)

## VMT

- people are willing to drive longer distances if the benefit of the trip increases
- low VMT != low traffic congestion
- denser urban developments = lower VMT rates
    - not necessarily directly related

# VMT metrics

- total vmt: all vmt in a certain zone
- project-generated vmt: all vmt generated by a single origin/destination
    - ignores zone boundaries
- VMT per capita: project generated vmt divided by number of people in the project area
    - normalize population with vmt
- project wffect on vmt: looks at what happens to a given area if you construct a project (effect on total vmt as a result of a project)

# TDM as Mitigation

- TDM+ tool incorporates various strategies to mitigate VMT
- strategy examples:
    - offers up more travel modes
    - make parking more expensive

# Safety

- facilities should not just be safe/not dangerous, must evaluate based on design standards
- take into account collisions, not accidents

# Safety Mitigation

- reduce kinetic energy between objects (collisions)
    - reduce speed/weight of vehicles
    - reduce speed differential between users
- seperate users in space and/or time
- provide consistent user expectations (make sure there are no surprises to make the usage of a roadway/intersection intuitive)

# site plan recommendations

- valuable to graphically illustrate travel challenges to highlight potential issues (overflowing capacity, large queue lines, etc.)
- make recommendations based on expected issues
